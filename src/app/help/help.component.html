                <p class="text-xl">BoneTwin is an analytical tool designed to facilitate the pair-matching of commingled skeletal elements by providing the probability that a pair of bones originate from the same individual or from different individuals, along with key supporting statistics. Prior to using BoneTwin, users must first superimpose 3D mesh models of the bones and calculate the mean distance (D<sub>mean</sub>) and standard deviation of distances (D<sub>sd</sub>) between corresponding faces using CloudCompare (https://cloudcompare.org/index.html). These variables (D<sub>mean</sub> and D<sub>sd</sub>) serve as inputs for the logistic regression models in BoneTwin.</p>
